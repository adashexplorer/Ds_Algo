## Linear Data Structures -
- These DS `store data sequentially` and are generally easy to traverse in a single run.
- Divided into following categories -
    - `Array`
    - `String` (An array of characters)
    - `Linked List`
    - `Stack`
    - `Queue`
    - `Hashing` (HashTable, HashMap etc)
    - `Bit Manipulation`

## Non-Linear Data Structures -
- These DS `don't store elements sequentially` and traversal often requires recursion / queues / stacks
- Divided into following categories -
  - `Trees`
  - `Graphs`
  - `Binary Search Tree (BST)`
  - `Tries`
  - `Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union Find`
  - `Advanced Trees`
  - `Heap`
